Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas.

I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
