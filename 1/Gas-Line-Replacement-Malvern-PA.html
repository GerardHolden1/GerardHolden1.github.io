<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home.

<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Other indications you may need to repipe include rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail signs that precede repiping services, they do not always indicate repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the issue to figure out the best strategy.</p>
