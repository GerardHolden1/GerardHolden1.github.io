<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
