<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies San Ramon CA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
