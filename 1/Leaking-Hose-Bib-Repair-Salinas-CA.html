To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod secures the tank by attracting damaging materials. By having the anode rod examined routinely and changed as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>

Either of these leaks can be tough to fix by yourself since the tank or the whole toilet should be taken off the floor for a correct repair. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more expensive repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained personnel who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
