<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>To avoid these things from obstructing your drains and triggering damage, Larry & Sons advises that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your home. These nifty additions to your sinks and tubs can decrease the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drains. Many waste disposal unit will need a new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entrance at the bottom of the sink as well as a brief length of pipe that extends listed below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>Older toilets typically utilize 3.5 gallons or more per flush, particularly if they were manufactured prior to 1994. Newer models just use 1.6 gallons per flush while still offering the very same flushing power. More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a double flushing system which just uses 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless hot water heater: These water heaters heat quicker than conventional water heaters. They also use up less area because they do not need a tank.</p>
