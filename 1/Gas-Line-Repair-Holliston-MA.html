<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
