<p>Covert water leakages are often demanding and have Possibly Severe Effects. Changing your flapper may need slightly different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
