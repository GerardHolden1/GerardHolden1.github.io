While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
