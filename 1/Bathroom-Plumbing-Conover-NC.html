<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your unit. If your system is getting close to 10 years old, it's generally not wise to pay for repairs if they are worth more than half of the price of a new system. If problems end up being more frequent with an older system, then it is recommended that you have the waste disposal unit changed. We offer a number of affordable and extremely effective systems, and provide upfront pricing prior to work begins so there are not a surprises. It is our objective to provide all of our valued clients throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding locations the service they need at a rate they can pay for.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater has required multiple repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it replaced. A great rule of thumb for water heaters is this: since the life-span of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
