<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - mainly with sinks.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for locals. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you add a water softener, it gets rid of the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes great.</p>
