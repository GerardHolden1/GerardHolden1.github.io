<p>This is the classic concern that many house owners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The answer is completely dependent on your special situation. For instance, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but is in otherwise great condition, we would suggest fixing it. Nevertheless, if the pipe is continuously leaking and requires regular repairs, we would advise repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever recommend services or products that would not genuinely benefit the customer.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regrowth cycle.

The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap might be used to attain this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
