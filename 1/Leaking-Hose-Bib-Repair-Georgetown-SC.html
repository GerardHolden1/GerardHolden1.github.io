<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>For RPZ devices, drainage capability will be sized to accommodate both intermittent discharges and a disastrous failure of the relief valve. Describe producers flow curves to figure out optimal discharge rate based upon supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is higher.
