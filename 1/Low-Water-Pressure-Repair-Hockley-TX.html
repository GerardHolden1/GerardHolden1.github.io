<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
