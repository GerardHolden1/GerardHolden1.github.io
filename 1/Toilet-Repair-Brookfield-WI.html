<p>Say you decide to go that route. The next concern is whether you can install it yourself.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
