<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of products utilized to develop a garbage disposal unit: aluminum and stainless steel.
