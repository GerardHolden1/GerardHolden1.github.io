<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the issue stems with the community system, it's still clever to generate the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I bought individually from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Lot of times easy repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a fixed cost of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your scenario and inform you what requires to be done, however if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the expense. A plumber might charge $50-$ 100 to detect the problem and come. 2 Having to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a vacation will cost more.</p>
