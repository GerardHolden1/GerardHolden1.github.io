<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
