Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
