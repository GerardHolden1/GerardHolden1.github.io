<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
