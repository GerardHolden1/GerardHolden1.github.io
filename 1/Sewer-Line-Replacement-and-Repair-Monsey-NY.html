<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is very important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.
