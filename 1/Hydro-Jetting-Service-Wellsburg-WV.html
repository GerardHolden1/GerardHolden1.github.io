<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or business, and its capability to function is essential. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root invasion or a large clog.

Small clogs can become huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>

<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Wellsburg WV</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion refers to what occurs when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens since the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to substantial property damage. Watch out for moist, green patches in your lawn, a relentless sewage smell in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common signs of root intrusion.</p>
<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, an unique type of black pipe should be utilized that is covered with a special plastic material that keeps the moisture out. This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and likewise because the plastic covering actually secures the pipe much better than a galvanized finish would.</p>
