<p>Backpressure might occur when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>Standard tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a big storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a pre-programmed level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
