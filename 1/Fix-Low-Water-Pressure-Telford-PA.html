If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was constructed years prior to that, possibilities are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>
