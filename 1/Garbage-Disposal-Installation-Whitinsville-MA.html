<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product.

Be sure to purchase a circuitry package with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you link the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
