<p>Covert water leaks are typically stressful and have Potentially Major Repercussions. Changing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>Many disposals will last between 10 and 12 years prior to requiring replacement. Indications that your disposal needs to be replaced consist of requiring to press the reset button frequently, the blades no longer slicing up the waste well or taking longer to chop up the waste, leaking from the bottom of the system, regular obstructions, or visible corrosion on the system itself.</p>
