<p>Inadequately installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy task. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
