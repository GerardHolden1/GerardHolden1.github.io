<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Oxford OH</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both areas. After an initial inspection and testing of a newly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer tested on an annual basis.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- essentially 2 layers of protection. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just because they will be on a certification test.</p>
