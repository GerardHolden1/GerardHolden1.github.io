And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, ensuring your trip lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those little daily inconveniences - that many people simply live with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
