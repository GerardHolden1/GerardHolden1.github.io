An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
