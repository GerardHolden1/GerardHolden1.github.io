<p>Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt.
