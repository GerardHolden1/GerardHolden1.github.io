<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not included a power cord connected. Get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Make certain to acquire an electrical wiring package with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, guarantee the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>
<p>Step 6: To link the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then connect the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by aligning the three tabs with the mounting ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then connect the dishwasher drain. Ensure the discharge pipe is lined up correctly and link your drains-- use a T-pipe prior to your P-trap.</p>
