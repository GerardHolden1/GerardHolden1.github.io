<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Lula GA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
