<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A license is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>

While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
