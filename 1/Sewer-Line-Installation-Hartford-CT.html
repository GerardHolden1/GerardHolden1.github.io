The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
