<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
