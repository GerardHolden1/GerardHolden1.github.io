<p>Backflow preventers need to only be repaired when the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
