<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from hazardous contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices containing a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a process known as backflow.</p>

<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is a reliable method to totally clear your main sewer line. Most people frequently refer to rooting as drain cleaning, nevertheless, this is not totally precise. Rootering a line with a drain machine breaks through a blockage triggering a backup. Hydro-jetting is a different type of service to completely clean the drain line.</p>
