<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
