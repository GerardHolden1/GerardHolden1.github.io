<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
