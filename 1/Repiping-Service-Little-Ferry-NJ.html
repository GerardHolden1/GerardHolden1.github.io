<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
