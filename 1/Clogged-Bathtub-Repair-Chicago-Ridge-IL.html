<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water devices? This is a great indication that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be replaced.

<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which styles are best for specific applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow variety from the relatively basic to the complex and really sophisticated.</p>

<p>Backflow threatens due to the fact that it can pollute the general public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals. In 2010, for instance, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky primary school suffered nausea and other signs after a contractor dealing with the A/C system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
