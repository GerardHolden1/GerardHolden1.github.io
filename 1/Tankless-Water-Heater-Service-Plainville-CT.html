At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction impact and draw potential pollutants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically discovered in many homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's needed.

The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
