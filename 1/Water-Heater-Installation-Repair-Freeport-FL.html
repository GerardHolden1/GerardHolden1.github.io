<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Freeport FL</h3>

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
