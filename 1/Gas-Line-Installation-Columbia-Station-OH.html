<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Columbia Station OH</h3>
<p>Numerous plumbing problems include blockages and clogged drains or pipes.

When you come across a covered plumbing problem, no matter how big or how small, contact AHS for assistance.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
