<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
