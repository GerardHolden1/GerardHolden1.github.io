<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service West Monroe LA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does.

<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
