<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes.

If you have an older house and are experiencing major and frequent leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, given that I never want to see this company once again.</p>
