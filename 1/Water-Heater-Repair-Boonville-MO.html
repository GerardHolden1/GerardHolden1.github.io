<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another reliable technique is pipe relining.
