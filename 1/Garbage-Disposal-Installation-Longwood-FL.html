<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
