To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation procedure, shut off the water supply to your house.

As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
