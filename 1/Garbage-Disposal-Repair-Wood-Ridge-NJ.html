<p>This is particularly typical after returning from a holiday or not utilizing your home's water system for an extended amount of time.

We have a dedicated team of knowledgeable, highly-skilled, and professional plumbers who are at the helm of repairing all types of sinks.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak right away and often those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be effectively re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
