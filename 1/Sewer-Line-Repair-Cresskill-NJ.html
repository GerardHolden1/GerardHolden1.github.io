<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high threat of entering contact with toxins due to backflows. Lots of faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout. Aerators are created to control water circulation from faucets by introducing air into the water as it streams from the spout. Including air in this method preserves constant water pressure, which triggers the fixture to use less water.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve.
