<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
