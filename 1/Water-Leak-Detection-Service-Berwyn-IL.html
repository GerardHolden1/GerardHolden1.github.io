<p>The next step we should carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to guarantee the line is correctly flushed.</p>
