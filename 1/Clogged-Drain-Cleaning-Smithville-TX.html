<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Smithville TX</h3>
<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
