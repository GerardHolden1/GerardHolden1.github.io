<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for irrigation systems: Locals discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground sprinkler system.

Sprinkler Warehouse does not suggest AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a possible to contaminate drinking water. When one has stopped working, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to find.</p>
