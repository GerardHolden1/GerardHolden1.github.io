<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
