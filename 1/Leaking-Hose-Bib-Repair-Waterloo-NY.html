Fire protection system are created to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be created and set up to fulfill that specific threat or need. An aircraft garage will need a very different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary considerably.</p>
