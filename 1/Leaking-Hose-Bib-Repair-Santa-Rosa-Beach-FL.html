<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Santa Rosa Beach FL</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these issues.</p>
