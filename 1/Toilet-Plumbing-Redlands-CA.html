As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
<p>Frequent leakages: Leakages coming from your hot water heater are never a great sign. If your hot water heater has regular leaks or is continuously requiring repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the entire unit.
