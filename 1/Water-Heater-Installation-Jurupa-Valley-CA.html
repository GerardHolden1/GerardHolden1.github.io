<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both.
