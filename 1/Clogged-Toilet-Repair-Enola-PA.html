<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
