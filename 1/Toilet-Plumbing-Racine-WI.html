<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Racine WI</h3>
<p>Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber.

<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
