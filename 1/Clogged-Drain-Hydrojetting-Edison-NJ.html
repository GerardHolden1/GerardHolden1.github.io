In order to repipe your home, Cabrillo will need to eliminate little areas of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending on the size of your home, this process will likely take a few days to a week to complete. Do not worry, while we're dealing with your home we'll cover all of your furnishings, floors and other belongings so that our work does not make a mess. After the entire process is finished and your house is tidied up, we'll check to make sure that water is streaming properly through all of your brand-new pipes.</p>
<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less critical things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
