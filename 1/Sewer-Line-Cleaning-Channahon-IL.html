<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
