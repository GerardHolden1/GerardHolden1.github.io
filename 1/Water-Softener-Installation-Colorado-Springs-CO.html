The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Colorado Springs CO</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
