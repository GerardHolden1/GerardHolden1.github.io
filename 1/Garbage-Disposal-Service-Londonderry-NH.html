<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Londonderry NH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
