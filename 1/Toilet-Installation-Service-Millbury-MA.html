<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, often simply called fitters, install and keep pipes that may carry acids, gases, and chemicals. These pipes are primarily in manufacturing, commercial, and commercial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, as well as heating and cooling systems in large office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are designed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as gasfitters or sprinklerfitters.</p>
