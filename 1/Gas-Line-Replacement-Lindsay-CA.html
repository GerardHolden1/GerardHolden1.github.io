<p>According to the City of San Diego Water Department Customer Support Division, there are a number of elements that can lead to your drinking water becoming polluted. If you suspect your house is experience any contamination like the situations discussed listed below, contact Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air to get more information about our backflow preventer installation services.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental regulations. Local building regulations for example will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon before it can take place, preventing contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively easy to the complicated and very sophisticated.</p>

<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a fixture, sub-system, or system group is changed, a permit and inspection will not be required.

Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks.
