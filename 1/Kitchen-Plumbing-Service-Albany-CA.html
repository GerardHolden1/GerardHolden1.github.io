<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
