When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
<p>It is essential to employ a professional to install you water pressure regulator in order to ensure that the pressure is neither too high nor too low.

<p>The use of backflow preventers is connected to the water's usage. Backflow preventers are used to ensure the security and purity of the dispersed water.

If you think about what you put down the disposal, leakages can be unclean and will also eventually cause stress on other parts of your waste disposal unit. The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray.

A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
