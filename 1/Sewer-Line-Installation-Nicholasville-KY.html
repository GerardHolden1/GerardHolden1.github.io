<p>As discussed earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide is colorless and entirely odorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the appropriate places.

They are generally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
