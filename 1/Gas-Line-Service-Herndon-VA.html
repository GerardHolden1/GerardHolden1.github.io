The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Overall expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping needed to link to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>

Company then usually blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s or hasn't been redesigned, you will more than likely have old pipes that need changing.</p>

To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
