For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to work correctly. With electrical models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
