When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
