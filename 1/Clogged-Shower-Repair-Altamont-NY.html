When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, in addition to examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
