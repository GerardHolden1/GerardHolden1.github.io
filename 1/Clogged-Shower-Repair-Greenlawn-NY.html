As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
