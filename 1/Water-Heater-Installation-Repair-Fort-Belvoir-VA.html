<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
