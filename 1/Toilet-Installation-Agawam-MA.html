<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
