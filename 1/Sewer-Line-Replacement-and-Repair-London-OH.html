<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
