This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
