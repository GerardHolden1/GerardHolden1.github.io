<p>After showing up after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it leaked now due to the fact that of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
