However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does occur more often than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
