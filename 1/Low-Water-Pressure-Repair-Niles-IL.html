<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are much easier and less costly to install as electrical energy is currently available through the main power supply line.

After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, since I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
