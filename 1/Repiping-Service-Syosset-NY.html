<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed numerous repairs over the last few years. An excellent guideline for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer includes two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back siphonage and back pressure on non-health risk (low risk) systems.

Tip: Toss a towel on the floor underneath to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
