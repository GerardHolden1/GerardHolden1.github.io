<p>Garbage disposals are a vital feature in any contemporary kitchen. If you live in an older house, your sink might not have one, requiring you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to all of a sudden break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are eco-friendly and are resistant to splitting. Nevertheless, they're also the most pricey in this list and in areas with tough water (like Florida) they can establish pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>In general, toilets are quite basic to repair and operate. Nearly any part can be removed and replaced reasonably quickly and quickly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Damaged toilets can do some really extensive, expensive, and ... stinky damage to a house. When something fails, and your kitchen sink starts backing up, your toilet will not flush, or you can't take a shower, you need for professional assistance right now. That's where High 5 Plumbing comes in. With years of market experience, we understand how to take on a variety of drain problems.</p>
<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Many times easy repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a fixed cost of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a fee to look at your circumstance and tell you what needs to be done, however if you employ them, that charge will be deducted from the costs. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to come and identify the problem. 2 Having to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a vacation will cost more.</p>
