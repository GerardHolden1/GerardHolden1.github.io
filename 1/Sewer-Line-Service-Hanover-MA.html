<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Hanover MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
