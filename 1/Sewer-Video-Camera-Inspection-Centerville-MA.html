<h3>Drain Cleaning Service in Centerville Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>If you  wish to remove the salt, simply fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is pricey: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. A lot of high-pressure water jetters will run with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
