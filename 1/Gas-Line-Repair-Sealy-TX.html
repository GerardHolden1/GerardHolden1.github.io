<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
