I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
