Existing policies limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
