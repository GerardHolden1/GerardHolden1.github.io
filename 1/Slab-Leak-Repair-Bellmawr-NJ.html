<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, in addition to checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
