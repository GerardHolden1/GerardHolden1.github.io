Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept devoid of harmful contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the potable water system. This can take place through a procedure referred to as backflow.</p>

The specifics - where you begin, just how much you cut, and how it's all set up - are distinct to each installation.
