<p>After getting here after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now since of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, given that I never want to see this company again.</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
