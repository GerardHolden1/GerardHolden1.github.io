Backflow into a public water system can infect the water or contaminate in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system unusable or unsafe to drink), and each water supplier has an obligation to supply water that is usable and safe to drink under all foreseeable scenarios. In addition, customers generally have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is always safe to consume. For these factors, your water district need to take safety measures to safeguard its public water system against backflow.</p>
