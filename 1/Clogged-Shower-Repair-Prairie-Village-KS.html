<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Prairie Village KS?</h3>
<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of deterioration control.
