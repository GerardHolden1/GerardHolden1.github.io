Nevertheless, it includes a reasonable amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inadequate, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>
