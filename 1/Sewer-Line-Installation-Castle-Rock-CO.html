<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is very important to identify the specific location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can conserve you countless dollars in repairs.
