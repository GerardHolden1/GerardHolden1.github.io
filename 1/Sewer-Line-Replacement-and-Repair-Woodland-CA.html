<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. To find the pressure loss through the backflow preventer you will need to consult the producer's literature. All of the following backflow preventer types are offered in a number of sizes. There's a factor we're the leading sewer and drain cleaning company and drain repair service provider for services in the Columbus, Ohio area: we do the job right-- and we do it right the very first time. We serve commercial, multi-family residential and commercial customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Because of negative or decreased pressure in the supply side of the water system, back siphonage happens when water is drawn or pulled backwards.
