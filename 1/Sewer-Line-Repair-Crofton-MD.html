<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal.

<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
