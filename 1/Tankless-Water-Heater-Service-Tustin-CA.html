<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Since copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the regular direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Lowered Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the normal direction.</p>

<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a really pricey option.</p>
