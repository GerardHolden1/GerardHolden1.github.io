<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
