<p>The law also needs annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in penalties and termination of water service. Due to the fact that backflow preventer devices are made up of moving springs, seals, and parts and undergo corrosive compounds, wear, and fatigue, it's vital to effectively keep them to guarantee they effectively operate and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>Two styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds.
