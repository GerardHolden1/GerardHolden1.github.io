<p>The typical life expectancy of an electric water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, little pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet a larger one underneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in locations where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
