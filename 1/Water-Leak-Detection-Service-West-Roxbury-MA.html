After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to guarantee the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
