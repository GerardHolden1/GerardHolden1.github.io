The City requires backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that might permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These gadgets are subject to testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they are subject to periodic tests later on, as well.</p>
