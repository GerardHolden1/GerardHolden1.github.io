I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
