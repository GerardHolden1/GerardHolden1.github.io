When figuring out the hardness of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey said that both Belding and Greenville city water measures around 18 gpg, which is thought about incredibly hard water, leaving telltale signs like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to difficult to eliminate.

It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
