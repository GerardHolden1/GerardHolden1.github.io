<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Older toilets usually utilize 3.5 gallons or more per flush, specifically if they were produced prior to 1994. More recent designs only use 1.6 gallons per flush while still offering the exact same flushing power. More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a dual flushing system which only utilizes 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless water heaters: These hot water heater heat quicker than conventional hot water heater. They also take up less area considering that they don't need a tank.</p>
