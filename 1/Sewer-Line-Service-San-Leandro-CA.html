<p>The simplest method to keep you and your family safe from the prospective dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
