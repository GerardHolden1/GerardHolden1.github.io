I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
