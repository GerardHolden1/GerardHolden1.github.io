Fire protection system are designed to match the danger that exists in the places they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be created and set up to satisfy that specific hazard or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>
