Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
