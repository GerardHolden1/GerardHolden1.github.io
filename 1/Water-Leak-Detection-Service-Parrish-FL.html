<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction crew is readily available for initial investigation of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets. City employees will examine and eliminate blockages in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is responsible for. You may have to wait up until the storm has gone away to have the backup solved if the issue is the outcome of too much storm water in the system.</p>
<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a good idea to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain professional like TLC will use a camera to inspect your drain system. Typically, if you have several drain problems you may have a drain line break someplace in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can determine the issue and locate so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>Even if you believe you can manage it on your own, you probably don't have a camera appropriate for detecting the cause of blockage around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake helpful, however when's the last time you utilized it-- and are you sure you're doing it right? Often the best thing you can do for your home is call someone with the right tools and know-how to fix your issue rapidly and efficiently. For Tewksbury, Andover, Billerica, and nearby neighborhoods, Gregory Ostroski Plumbing and Heating is typically the very first company individuals require a drain cleaning service that works and is easy on their pipes.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
