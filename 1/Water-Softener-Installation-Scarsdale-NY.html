<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
<p>The key to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
