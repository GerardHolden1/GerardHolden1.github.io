<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
