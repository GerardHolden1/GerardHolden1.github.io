<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>We focus on tub and shower replacement and full bathroom remodeling at extremely competitive pricing. Turn on the gas and check connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When ended up, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to advice that accompanies the photos to make certain the connections are tight.</p>
<p>Another choice is to utilize salt pellets in the salt water tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will remove salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more conventional method, Kinetico covers all your options. Your local Kinetico water specialist will work with you to select the water softener that's right for you.</p>
