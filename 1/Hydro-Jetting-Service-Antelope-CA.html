<p>We focus on tub and shower replacement and full bathroom remodeling at extremely competitive pricing. Turn on the gas and check connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When ended up, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to advice that accompanies the photos to make certain the connections are tight.</p>
<p>Another choice is to utilize salt pellets in the salt water tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will remove salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking.
