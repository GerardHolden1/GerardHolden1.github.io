After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
