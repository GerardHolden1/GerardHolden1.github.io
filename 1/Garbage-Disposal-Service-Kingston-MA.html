<p>Day to day use need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing.
