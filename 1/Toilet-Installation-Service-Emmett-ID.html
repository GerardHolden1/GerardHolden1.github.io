<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
