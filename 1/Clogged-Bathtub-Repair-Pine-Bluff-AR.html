<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
