<p>Woodbury, along with numerous other communities and organizations, has discovered the very best way to prevent these discolorations from taking place is by lowering the number of times your water softener restores. "Regrowing" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, many water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be fixed by merely resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>

<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
