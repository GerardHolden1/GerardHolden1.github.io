<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
