<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
