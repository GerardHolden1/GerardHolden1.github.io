After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
<p>The repair technician must have the ability to determine the many various manufacturers and the particular designs produced throughout the years. Some models might seem similar on the outdoors but might require various repair parts on the within, so the repair professional need to be able to identify the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. Sometimes the serial number of the assembly will be needed to distinguish one model from another. It is necessary to understand the appropriate model to assure you get the proper repair parts.</p>
