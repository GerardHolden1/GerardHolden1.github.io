<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
