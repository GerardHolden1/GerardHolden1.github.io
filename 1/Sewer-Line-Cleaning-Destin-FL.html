To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
