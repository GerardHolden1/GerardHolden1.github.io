<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
