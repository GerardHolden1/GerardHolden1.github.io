<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Southaven MS</h3>
<p>On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber.

Costs depend on the precise repair required, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. hiring a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
