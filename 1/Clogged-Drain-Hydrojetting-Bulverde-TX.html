<p>While many hot water heater problems can be successfully fixed, some issues will require complete water heater replacement.

<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they would not take responsibility if it dripped now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never want to see this company once again.</p>
<p>During installation, water and electrical energy are shut down to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty. Loosen the nuts that link the drain pipe, consisting of the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a monkey wrench for metal connections. Location a pail below the drain pipe to catch any water that leaks out.</p>
