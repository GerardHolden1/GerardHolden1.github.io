Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
