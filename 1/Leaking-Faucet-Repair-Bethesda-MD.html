<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Bethesda MD</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
