<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
