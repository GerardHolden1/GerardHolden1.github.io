<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water.

Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
