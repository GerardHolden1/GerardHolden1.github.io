<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Mapleton UT</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was regularly blocking. They came out and dug a new path for the line connected it to the sewer and whatever.

<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
