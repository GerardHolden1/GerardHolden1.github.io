Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you need a permit, call your local department of inspections and ask.
