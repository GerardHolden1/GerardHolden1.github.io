For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Also, germs and fungis also form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances. However, check out the manufacturer's directions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
