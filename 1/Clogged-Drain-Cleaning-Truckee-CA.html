<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water.

As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
