<p>The usual option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include device wires connected, and others do not. If yours does not, get rid of the cover plate underneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's instructions. A lot of standard disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're finished, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
<p>If you are choosing in between replacing and fixing, there are a couple of different elements to consider. Initially, you need to consider how long you have actually had your existing unit.
