<p>Softeners mainly remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is known as fouling. Sometimes it might be essential to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer guidelines to prevent contamination.</p>
