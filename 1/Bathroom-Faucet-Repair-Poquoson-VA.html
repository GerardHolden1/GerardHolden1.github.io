<p>Therefore, we see the shift from huge transport pipelines (aqueducts) supplying water to entire cities to big distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or large centers, to medium circulation pipelines and finally to little service pipelines.

<p>New houses built with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become covered inside. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of three to five months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
