<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not included a power cable attached. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to acquire a wiring kit with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the wiring harness to the disposer, guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>
