<h3>Drain Cleaning in Indialantic Florida</h2>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
