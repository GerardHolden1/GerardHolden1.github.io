<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not in fact glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, pierced or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is an effective way to completely clear your main sewer line. Many people typically refer to rooting as drain cleaning, nevertheless, this is not totally accurate. Rootering a line with a drain machine breaks through an obstruction triggering a backup. Hydro-jetting is a separate type of service to entirely clean the drain line.</p>
