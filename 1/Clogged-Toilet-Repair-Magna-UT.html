<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. A license is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>

<p>In many states, except Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your home or organisation. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the very same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and water pipes. When water enters your house from the main supply of water line, it must only ever stream in one instructions: into your house.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to restore and go into the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
