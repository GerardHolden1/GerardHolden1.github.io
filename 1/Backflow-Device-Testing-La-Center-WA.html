<p>There are certain plumbers who focus on plumbing related to home remodeling and new construction. When a new house is built, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed properly and to local, state, and federal code.

Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line increasing to the faucet (usually with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap.

<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these types of sinks.

Your plumbing inspector will tell you if they're needed.</p>
