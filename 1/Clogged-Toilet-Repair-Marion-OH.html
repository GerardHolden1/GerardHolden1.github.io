It is most likely that your dip tube is broken if you discover that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob.</p>
<p>The most typical concern with faucets is the leak and drip Not just can this happen in any location with a faucet such as kitchen areas, restrooms, and more - but it can be a progressive concern that ends up being a significant problem. The issue with any leak or drip with a faucet is determining the root source. Often the leak or drip will be brought on by a harmed faucet, worn seals or washers, corroded -rings and gaskets, or elements that are simply too old and need to be replacement.
