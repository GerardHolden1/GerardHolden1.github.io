<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
