<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Provo UT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
