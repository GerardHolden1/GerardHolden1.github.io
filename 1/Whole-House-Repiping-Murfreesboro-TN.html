<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the regular direction from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Decreased Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the regular direction.</p>
<p>The system has returned to a no need condition (no valves open downstream).
