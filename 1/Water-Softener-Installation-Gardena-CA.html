<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines.

However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
