<p>Most residential homes have roofing seamless gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water far from your house. When those downspouts are linked to underground drains that flow to community storm drains or street rain gutters, they often end up being clogged with tree roots and debris.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
