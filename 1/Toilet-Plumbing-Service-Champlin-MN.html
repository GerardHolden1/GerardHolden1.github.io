As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
