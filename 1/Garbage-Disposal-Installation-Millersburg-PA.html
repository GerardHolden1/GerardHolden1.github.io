<p>When picking the appropriate system protection there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be looked at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and set up to meet that specific threat or need. An aircraft garage will need an extremely different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also differ significantly.</p>
