Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
