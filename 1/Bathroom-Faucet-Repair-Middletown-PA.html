<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections relating to the administration of Short article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the public water supply. This can take place at any time, such as during a water main break or throughout a large firefighting effort.</p>
