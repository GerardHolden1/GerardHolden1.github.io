Low water pressure may make your morning shower less than stimulating.</p>
<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security.
