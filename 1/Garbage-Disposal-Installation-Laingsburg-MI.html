Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our customers is kept free from hazardous contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment including a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is thought about a testable backflow preventer, but it is likewise very uncommon. They were produced so as to provide the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device.
