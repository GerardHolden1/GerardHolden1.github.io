<p>Back-siphonage is backflow triggered by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water supply or customer's potable water system.

<p>DCVs are specifically created to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems.

Light-duty commercial-grade waste disposal unit start around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending on size, brand and functions.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.
