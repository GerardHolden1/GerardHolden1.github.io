Eventually, the water may not be able to drain rapidly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly supporting. When this happens, it may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience clogs in numerous drains at the same time in your house, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>

Loosen the coupling nut that links the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Pointer: Toss a towel on the floor underneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
