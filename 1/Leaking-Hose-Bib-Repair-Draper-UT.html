Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
