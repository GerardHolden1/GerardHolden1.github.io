<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Boxford MA</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are many factors that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
