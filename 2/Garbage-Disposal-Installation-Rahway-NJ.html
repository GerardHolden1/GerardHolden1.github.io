<p>Backflow is dangerous due to the fact that it can contaminate the public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals. In 2010, for instance, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered queasiness and other symptoms after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>

Your local Culligan Guy will review the solidity of your water, the size of your household and even your house's plumbing before advising the ideal water softening option for you and your spending plan.

Please have your permit number and three-digit inspection code prepared. Inspections might be scheduled until 8 p.m. for the next day.</p>
