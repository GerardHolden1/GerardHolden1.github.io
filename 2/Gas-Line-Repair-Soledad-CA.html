<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

If you're not comfortable making electrical connections for your garbage disposal installation, you can buy a disposal that already has a cable attached. Ask at your house center or home appliance store, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cord attached.</p>
