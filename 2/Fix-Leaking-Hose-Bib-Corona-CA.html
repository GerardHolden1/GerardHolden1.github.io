<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Corona CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
