<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unnecessary clogs even more down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be cleaned of impurities and will need to be replaced. (This must not hold true if the resin is periodically regrowed and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a solidifying lining product which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
