<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
