These pipes are primarily in production, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, as well as heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are developed for the flow of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters may specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
<p>Inadequately installed gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional.
