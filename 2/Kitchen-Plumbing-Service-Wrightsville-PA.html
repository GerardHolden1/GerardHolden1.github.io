<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: During regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never takes place.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a temporary fix. It's a long-term solution for the entire plumbing system in your house or organisation. We switch off the supply of water, eliminate old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the new system is set up, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's excellent to opt for you.</p>
