<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the drinkable system offering the make-up water. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Prospective contaminants can then go into the drinkable water system. The very best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
