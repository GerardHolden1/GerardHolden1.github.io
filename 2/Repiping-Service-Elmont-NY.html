<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, particles between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This allows pressure to adjust between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer includes two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back and back siphonage pressure on non-health hazard (low danger) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that links the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Pointer: Toss a towel on the floor underneath to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
