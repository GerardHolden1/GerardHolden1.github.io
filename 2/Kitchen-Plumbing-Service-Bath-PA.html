<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Bath PA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
