For instance, if your kitchen sink is supported since you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can separate the blockage and send it down the pipes. We suggest you opt for drain snaking instead of utilizing strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners may do more damage than good by rusting your pipes.</p>
