Some disposer units do not featured a power cable connected. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case.

When you link the wiring harness to the disposer, make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
