<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
