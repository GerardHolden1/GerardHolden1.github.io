<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Jefferson City MO</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
