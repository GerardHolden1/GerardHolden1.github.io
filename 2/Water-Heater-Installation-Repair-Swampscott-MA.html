<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
