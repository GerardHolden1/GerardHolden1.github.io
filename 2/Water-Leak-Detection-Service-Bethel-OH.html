I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
