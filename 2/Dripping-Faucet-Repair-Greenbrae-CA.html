<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your security, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly crucial! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide 2 kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Regular leakages: Leakages originating from your water heater are never a great sign. If your hot water heater has regular leaks or is continuously requiring repairs, it is likely more economical to replace the entire unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your house's water pipes that permits water to stream in one direction but never ever in the opposite instructions. Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed multiple repairs over the last couple of years. A great guideline for water heaters is this: because the life-span of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
