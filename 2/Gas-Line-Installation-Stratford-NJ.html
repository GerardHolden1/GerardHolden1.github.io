<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed versus it will result in decapitation, it may scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
