<p>Nearly all manufactures can identify the age of a water heater from the design and identification number. Have a licensed plumber identify whether it depends on current code and safely working. Ask the plumber to evaluate and document the size of the hot water heater when they're out to perform the inspection, and whether it satisfies the needs of the home.</p>
