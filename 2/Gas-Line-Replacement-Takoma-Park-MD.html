<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Some disposer systems do not included a power cable connected. If this is the case, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1).

<p>PEX meets building regulations almost everywhere, includes a 25-year guarantee, and puts a smaller sized hit on your budget plan than copper.
