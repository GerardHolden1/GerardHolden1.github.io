Worms for irrigation systems: Locals discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler. Throughout a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The homeowner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to shower his kid.</p>
<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is provided for purposes of eliminating bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly top priorities for a town and its citizens but tough water can adversely impact faucets and appliances in a house.
