<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion.

Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
