<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a system, component, or sub-system  group is replaced, a permit and inspection shall not be needed. This will not prevent the licensee from getting permits and inspections for such work if so desired.</p>

Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
