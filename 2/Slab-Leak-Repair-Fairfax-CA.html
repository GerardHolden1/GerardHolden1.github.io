<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that just initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has broken down in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers must just be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
