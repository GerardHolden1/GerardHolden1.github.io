<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, broken pipe out while changing it with a new one at the same time.

<p>Home remodeling or home renovations are the best time to replace your home's pipes.

Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. Numerous homes in my community being repiped and have spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger significant damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
