<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of corrosion control.
