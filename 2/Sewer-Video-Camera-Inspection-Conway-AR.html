<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Conway AR</h3>
<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can pollute the general public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals.

<p>While lots of hot water heater problems can be efficiently fixed, some issues will require complete hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its normal lifespan (generally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or substantial rust, it may be time to think about replacement.</p>
