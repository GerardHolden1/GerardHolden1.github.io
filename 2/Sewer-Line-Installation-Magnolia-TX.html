<p>Yes, we have actually all been there, when the toilet clogs and we're left feeling helpless without the power to flush! A clog normally involves increasing water, followed by panic and plunging. If this is a common event, there's most likely a larger problem of obstruction in the drain or sewer-line. Our plumbers can help you to identify and remove the problem-- quickly.</p>
<p>Though it's not always required, sometimes the plumber may need to update or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot light might need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or vegetation near the gas leak will be blemished or degraded if the gas line is damaged.

As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
