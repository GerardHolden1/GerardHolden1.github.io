<p>We focus on tub and shower replacement and full bathroom redesigning at extremely competitive rates. Switch on the gas and check connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to recommendations that accompanies the pictures to ensure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Typically, this is since the system is dated or not working correctly. Whatever the reason, you can be missing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>
