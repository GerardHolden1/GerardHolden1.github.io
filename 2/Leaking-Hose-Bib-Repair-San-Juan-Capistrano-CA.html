<p>If you get your water from a neighborhood water system, check to see if your neighborhood already softens the water. Soft water provided by an utility does not need extra softening and may cause deterioration concerns for your home. An apprentice plumbing license represents a plumber who has actually simply begun training. If you already have an old one installed, you'll have to remove your garbage disposal first.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
