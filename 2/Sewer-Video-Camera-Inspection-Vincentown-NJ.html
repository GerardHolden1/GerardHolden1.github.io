<p>Because of negative or reduced pressure in the supply side of the water system, back siphonage happens when water is drawn or pulled backwards. Contaminated water can be pulled into the supply line from sprinklers or other emitters if the irrigation line does not have a backflow preventer at the cross-connection.

<p>When choosing the correct system protection there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the threat that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to fulfill that specific danger or need. An airplane hangar will need a very various fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
