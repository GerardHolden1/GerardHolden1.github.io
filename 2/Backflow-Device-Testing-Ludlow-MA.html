<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a community water system, check to see if your neighborhood already softens the water. Soft water provided by an energy does not need additional softening and may trigger rust issues for your home. An apprentice plumbing license symbolizes a plumber who has just started training. You'll need to remove your garbage disposal first if you already have an old one installed.</p>
