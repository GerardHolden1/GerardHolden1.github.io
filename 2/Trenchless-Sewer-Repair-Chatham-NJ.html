<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
