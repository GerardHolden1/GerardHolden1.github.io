<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>There are a number of indications to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and fixtures in your house have been switched off. 3) The hot water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water costs, often really quickly.</p>
