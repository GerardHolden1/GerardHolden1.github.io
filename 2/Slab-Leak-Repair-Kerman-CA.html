Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water really requires it. When needed, more recent units use electronic sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and therefore just regenerate.
