<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
