<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
