<p>The toilet takes a really long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of lowered pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never occurs.</p>
<p>In basic, toilets are quite basic to repair and run. Nearly any part can be eliminated and changed reasonably easily and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has a problem, the stakes are high.
