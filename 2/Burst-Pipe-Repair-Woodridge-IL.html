<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A response team is offered for preliminary examination of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700. City employees will examine and remove blockages in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is accountable for. If the problem is the result of excessive storm water in the system, you might have to wait up until the storm has actually subsided to have the backup fixed.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the municipal system, it's still clever to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
