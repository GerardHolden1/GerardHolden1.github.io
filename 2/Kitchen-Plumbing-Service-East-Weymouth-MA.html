<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber East Weymouth MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
