It should likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
