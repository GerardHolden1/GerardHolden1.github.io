For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you might contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Likewise, if you utilize your hose to fill a wading pool or hot tub, a reversal of the water flow could siphon pool or health club chemicals back through the garden hose and into your house's plumbing.</p>
