If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Dudley MA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
