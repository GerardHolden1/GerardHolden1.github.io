<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If everything is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall expenses. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will develop a good seal (though the gasket may result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
