A water heater installation is not the repair on which to develop your plumbing skills if you're relatively inexperienced. So save yourself some major problem by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I purchased separately from the disposal system.
