<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
