<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the level of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
