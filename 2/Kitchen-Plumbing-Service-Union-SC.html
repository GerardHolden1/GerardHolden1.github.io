<h3>Drain Clearing in Union South Carolina</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned main drain. By including perseverence and perseverance the task was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
