<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Clarksville MD</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
<p>Nothing can provide a home soft water like a water softener. And the benefits of treating that water even with a water softener far out weigh the damages triggered by our really difficult water.
