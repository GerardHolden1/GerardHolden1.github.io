Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention gadgets to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could allow tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices undergo testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In most cases, they undergo routine tests later, as well.</p>
