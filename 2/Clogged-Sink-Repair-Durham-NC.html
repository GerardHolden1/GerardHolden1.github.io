<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Durham NC</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
