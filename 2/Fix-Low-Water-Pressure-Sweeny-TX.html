<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
