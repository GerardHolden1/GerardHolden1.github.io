<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and rusts internally. When drawing water from galvanized water pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other pollutants flow into your drinking water. These contaminants also clog the pipe internally stopping the circulation of water to fixtures. After we test the drains and supply of water lines and clean up the area, your new sink will be prepared to use!
