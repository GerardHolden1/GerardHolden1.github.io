<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
