Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
