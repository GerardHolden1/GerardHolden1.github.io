<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I discover that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying.

Your water heater must be flushed once a year. It may have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never ever been flushed. That indicates eight fewer inches of hot water, not to point out the reality that your tap water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
