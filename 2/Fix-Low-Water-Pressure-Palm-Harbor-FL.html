No matter what sort of water heater you have or are interested in, the professionals at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our water heater installation services. For example, if your kitchen sink is supported because you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a fast drain snaking can separate the clog and send it down the pipes.

At first, these little deposits are safe, but with time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
