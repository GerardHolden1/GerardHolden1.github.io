Blanc likewise developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable.
