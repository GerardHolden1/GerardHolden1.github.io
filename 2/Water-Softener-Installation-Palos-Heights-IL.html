All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>

<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not require fixing the whole toilet. Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes numerous small moving parts that may need replaced with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>The sewer line in your house is a major part of your home's plumbing. Your sewer line belongs to your water system that carries out all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets.
