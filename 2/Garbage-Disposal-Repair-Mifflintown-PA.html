<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>A water softener must be set up as near to the water's point of entry into your home as possible. This ensures most of your plumbing and appliances are profiting of carrying the softened water. It's especially important to make sure your water softener is located prior to your water heater, as tough water does the best damage to hot water home appliances. You will want to install the softener in a dry, level area, like a basement or garage. It will need to be close to the water's main line, an electric outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the salt water solution from the regeneration cycle.</p>
<p>Next, make certain the installation area is clean. Remove any particles or clutter from the area, and keep your pets securely protected in another room of your house.
