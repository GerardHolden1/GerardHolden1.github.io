<p>When deciding on the proper system security there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a private basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are designed to match the threat that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that specific threat or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>
