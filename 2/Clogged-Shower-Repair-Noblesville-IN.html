<p>It's an excellent concept to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a few times. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to inspect your drain system.

The camera can recognize the issue and find so the drain can be fixed.</p>

This can take place in several places and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your home.</p>
