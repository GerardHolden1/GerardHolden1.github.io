<h3>Drain Plumbing in Mattapan Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the recently cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete fulfillment.</p>
