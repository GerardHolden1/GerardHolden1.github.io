<p>And so, we see the transition from huge transportation pipelines (aqueducts) offering water to whole cities to big circulation pipes (mains) servicing smaller sized communities or big centers, to medium distribution pipelines and lastly to small service pipelines.

<p>She knew about the service call charge. The 4 On Your Side Investigation found that's a typical cost. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would give an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation before dedicating to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed effectively, you might experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
