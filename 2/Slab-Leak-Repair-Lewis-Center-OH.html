<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>The very best way to avoid clogged drains is to use an enzyme drain cleaner as preventive maintenance. Enzyme cleaners like Lenzyme present enzymes and bacteria into your drain system to gnaw the gunk and build up. You can use this once a month to keep your drains free from buildup.

Water is immediately heated and provided through the hot water tap. There is absolutely no need to wait on warm water as there is no storage tank and all the water is heated quickly.</p>
