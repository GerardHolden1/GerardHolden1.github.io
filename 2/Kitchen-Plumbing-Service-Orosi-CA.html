<p>Pipefitters and steamfitters, sometimes simply called fitters, install and preserve pipes that might bring gases, acids, and chemicals. These pipes are primarily in production, commercial, and industrial settings.

Steamfitters specialize in systems that are designed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as gasfitters or sprinklerfitters.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
