When switched on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Services Around San Leandro CA</h3>

Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
