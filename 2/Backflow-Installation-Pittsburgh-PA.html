You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
