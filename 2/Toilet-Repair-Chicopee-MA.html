<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners sell these days. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Service providers then normally blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was built prior to the 1970s or hasn't been redesigned, you will most likely have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the ideal side of one of the lugs in the installing ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, turn the mounting ring counterclockwise to release the disposal. Know that the disposal might include water and food waste, so carry it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
