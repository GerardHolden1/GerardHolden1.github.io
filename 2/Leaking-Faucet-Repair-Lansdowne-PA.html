<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being coated within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
