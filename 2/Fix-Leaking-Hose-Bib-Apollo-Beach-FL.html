There are other aspects to think about depending upon the area you are in and the type of task to be completed. You may choose copper piping if the house is on a basement or crawlspace, instead of slab structure. If your neighborhood is prone to instances of pitted rust, though, listen to your plumber; they may suggest PEX for your area.
