The gas lines need to be calibrated to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak.</p>
