Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
