<p>If a cable has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time ahead of time, signing up with the cable television to the wires in package just before or just after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty simple to keep. The most crucial thing to remember is that they are actually food disposals. Items that would otherwise enter the garbage must not be put in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
