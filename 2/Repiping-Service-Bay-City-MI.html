For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of deterioration control.
