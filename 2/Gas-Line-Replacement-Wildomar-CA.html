<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

The flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be stained or deteriorated if the gas line is damaged. Contact our experts to determine the degree of the issue.</p>
