<p>The toilet takes a truly long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- described as the zone of reduced pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside, ensuring backflow never occurs.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard methods of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow.
