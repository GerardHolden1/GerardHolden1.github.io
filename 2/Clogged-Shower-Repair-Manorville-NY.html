<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
