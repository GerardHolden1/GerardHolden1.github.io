<p>The average life expectancy of an electric water heater is more than that of a gas one. Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain path, little pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.</p>
<p>Whenever you switch on a warm water tap in your home, cold water gets in the heater through a pipe. The sensor inside the heater turns on an electric component or a gas burner depending on the kind of tankless heater you have actually selected. Water is immediately heated and provided through the warm water tap. There is definitely no need to wait on hot water as there is no tank and all the water is heated instantly.</p>
