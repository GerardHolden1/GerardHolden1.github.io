After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never want to see this company once again.</p>

Our residential and commercial plumbers look after the rest. In many cases the toilet repair is an inexpensive part and a couple of modifications, although changes connect and can be a bit tricky.</p>
