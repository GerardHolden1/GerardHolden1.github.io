<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is capacity for the polluted water to become a health hazard if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
