<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard methods of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
