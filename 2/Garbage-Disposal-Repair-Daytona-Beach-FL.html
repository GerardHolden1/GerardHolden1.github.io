<p>Due to the fact that of the inherent design of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or fixed flow condition may trigger nuisance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly.

The water inside this tank is heated up and then launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a preset level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
