<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really needs it. Newer units use digital sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other key metrics based upon your water usage and for that reason just regrow when required. These newer systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
