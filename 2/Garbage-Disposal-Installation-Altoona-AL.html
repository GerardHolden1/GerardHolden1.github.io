<p>Daily use need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
