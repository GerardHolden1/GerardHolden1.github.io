<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
