<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair in Flower Mound Texas</h2>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.
