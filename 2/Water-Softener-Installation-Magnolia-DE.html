<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
