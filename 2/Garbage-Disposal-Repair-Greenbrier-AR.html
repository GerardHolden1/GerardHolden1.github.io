Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
