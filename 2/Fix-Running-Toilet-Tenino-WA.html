Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes.

<p>In addition to the garbage disposal unit, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you might need to consider when weighing the garbage disposal installation cost.

If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
