A waste disposal unit usually plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink.

Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures.
