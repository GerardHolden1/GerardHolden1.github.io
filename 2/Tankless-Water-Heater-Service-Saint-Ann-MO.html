<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Saint Ann MO</h3>
<p>Solid Blockages: Professional support is the best solution, if you find yourself provided with an especially stubborn clog.

Sewage back-flow is another major issue if you do not have a skilled look into your clog situation.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
