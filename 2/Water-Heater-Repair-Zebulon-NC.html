When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance occurs, infected water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention method made use of. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
