It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
