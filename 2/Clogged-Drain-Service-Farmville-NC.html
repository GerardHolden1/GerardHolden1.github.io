<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material.

Be sure to purchase a circuitry set with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable.</p>
