A leaking toilet is another typical issue house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely ways your toilet has a leak.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
