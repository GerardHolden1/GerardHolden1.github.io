Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my community being repiped and have actually talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
