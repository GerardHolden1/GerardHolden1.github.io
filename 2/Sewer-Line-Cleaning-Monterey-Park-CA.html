<p>Crucial tip: If you have a water softener and intend on not utilizing it, keep in mind to put the unit into bypass mode. 12. Verdonckt, C. and Nijs, C. (2007 ). In situ corrosion examination on the impact of softened and difficult water to domestic copper and galvanized steel drinking water systems." METALogic. Before you begin the inconveniences of traditional pipe replacement, think about pipe lining. Repair damage from breaks, deterioration, and more, without having to replace the entire pipe. Discover why pipe lining is the tested, cost-effective method of restoring your harmed sewer and waste lines.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
