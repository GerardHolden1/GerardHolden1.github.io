<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as laid out listed below. Both will develop an excellent seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
