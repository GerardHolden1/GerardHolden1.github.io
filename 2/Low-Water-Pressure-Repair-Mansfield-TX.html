<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
