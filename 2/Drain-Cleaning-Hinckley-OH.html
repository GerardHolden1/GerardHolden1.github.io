<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. It is necessary that only original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers must just be fixed when the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if needed, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
