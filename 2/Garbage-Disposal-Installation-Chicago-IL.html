<h3>Toilet Installation in Chicago Illinois</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
