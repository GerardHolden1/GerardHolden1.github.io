Water pressure might be or fail lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
