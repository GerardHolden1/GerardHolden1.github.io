<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
