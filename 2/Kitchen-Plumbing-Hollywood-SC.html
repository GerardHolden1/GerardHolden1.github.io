<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Hollywood SC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
