However, damage such as deep cracks may require a sink replacement.</p>
<p>As explained earlier in the post, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the correct areas.

They are typically sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
