Not only can dirty pipes trigger your water to drain gradually, but it can also trigger pipes to burst and sewage-disposal tank back-ups. Guarantee you do not have a plumbing catastrophe and ensure your pipes are clean. 1. Remove the garbage disposer and detach all the old traps and drain lines from below the sink.</p>
