After the entire procedure is ended up and your house is tidied up, we'll check to ensure that water is flowing correctly through all of your new pipes.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet much easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That indicates you need to cut off the extending ends later on with a hacksaw.
