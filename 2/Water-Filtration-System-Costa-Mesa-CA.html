<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to business? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water in fact needs it. Newer systems use computerized sensors that monitor bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water use and for that reason only restore when needed. These newer systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
