<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
