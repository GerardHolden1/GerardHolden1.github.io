<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps record wetness and sediment so that they do not go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that might enable tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These gadgets undergo testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. Oftentimes, they are subject to regular tests later, as well.</p>
