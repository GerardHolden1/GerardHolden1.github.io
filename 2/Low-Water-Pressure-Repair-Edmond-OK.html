<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Edmond OK</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
