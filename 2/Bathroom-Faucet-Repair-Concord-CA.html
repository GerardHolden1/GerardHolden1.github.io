<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that ran on the same concept however might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
