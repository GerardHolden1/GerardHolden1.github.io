Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be thought about very strong, however they were discovered to crack under pressure and tend to corrode within a couple of years). Today, most quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof.
