<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Clay NY</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to recognize and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially useful in finding an issue.</p>
<p>Examine the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is more than likely coming from the inside of your water heater. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you most likely have rusted piping.</p>
