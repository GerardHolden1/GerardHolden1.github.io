<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If everything is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the total expenses. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
