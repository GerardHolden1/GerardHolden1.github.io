<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just removes firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can buy designs with unique features that do whatever but add the salt, you will spend for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams freely from the sink drain into your pail, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is likely further down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your home can harm floorings, woodworking, and other important items such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can cause mold and far more serious structural damage. If neglected, leaking sewer water from your main house drain or home sewer can also trigger extensive damage.</p>
