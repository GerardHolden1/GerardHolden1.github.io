Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain path, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home.</p>

Water softening means expanding the life span of household machine, such as laundry machines, and the life span of pipelines. It also adds to the enhanced working, and longer lifespan of solar heating systems, cooling systems and many other water-based applications.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
