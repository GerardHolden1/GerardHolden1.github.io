<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord connected. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to purchase a circuitry kit with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer, make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>

Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
