<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
