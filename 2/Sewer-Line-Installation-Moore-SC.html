There are a lot of types of piping systems and conditions, it's an excellent concept to get a whole home plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit units might cost more when they have to match local water and sewer capabilities. The plumbing in the house must work well or backup can happen, and septic systems may need to be updated to work with the disposal.

<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic style of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least expensive, but likewise the least reliable option.

Sprinkler Storage facility does not suggest AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a potential to contaminate drinking water.
