<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
