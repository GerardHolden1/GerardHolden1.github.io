Utilizing his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink.

<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to check your drain system. Often, if you have several drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can determine the problem and locate so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal unit, there are a variety of upgrades and parts that you might need to consider when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
