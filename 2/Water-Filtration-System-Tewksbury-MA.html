<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line during installation. Fewer parts in the unit result in less tankless water heater repair consultations.</p>

A lot of high-pressure water jetters will run with up to 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
