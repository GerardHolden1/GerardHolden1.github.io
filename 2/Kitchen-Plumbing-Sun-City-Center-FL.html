<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair needs can be solved relatively quickly by a skilled handyman. At other times, nevertheless, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, analyzed, and cleared before being replaced. Sometimes, a handyman may identify that a replacement part is necessary (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to talk about repair choices.</p>
<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
