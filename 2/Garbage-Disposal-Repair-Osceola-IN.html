<p>Whether you need gas line installation or repair in Pittsburgh area, you must call Mr. Rooter to schedule skilled gas line repair, installation and piping in Pittsburgh, PA and all close-by cities. Like almost everything in life, there's a great and bad  side to both gas and electric hot water heater. But, for instance, just like the downside of lemons to some people is that they are sour, to others, that's a benefit. It depends on point of view, and what you as an individual feel are the benefits you and your family need a lot of.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then examine the status of your water heater's anode rod. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this holds true. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you most likely have rusted piping.</p>
