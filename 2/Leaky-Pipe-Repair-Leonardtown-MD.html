<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks.

You might have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
