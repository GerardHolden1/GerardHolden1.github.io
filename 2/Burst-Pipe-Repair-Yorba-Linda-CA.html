An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.
