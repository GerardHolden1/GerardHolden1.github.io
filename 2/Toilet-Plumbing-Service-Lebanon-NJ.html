If you smell a strong whiff of gas from your vehicle when it is running, you may have a gas leak from the fuel line. It is necessary to repair this immediately to avoid a surge.

<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
