<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were extremely professional and did an amazing job.

Now, if this staining just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that requires to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
