<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
