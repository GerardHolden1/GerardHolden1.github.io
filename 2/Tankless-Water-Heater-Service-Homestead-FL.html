The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per linear foot.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a double flushing system which just utilizes 0.9 gallons per flush.
