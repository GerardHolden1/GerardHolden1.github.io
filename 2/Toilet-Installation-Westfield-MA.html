<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines.

<p>So Professional!!!! I am so impressed with this company. They reacted to a hot water heater issue at my business within thirty minutes of me calling. I would recommend Marin H2O for any plumbing problem. They are exceptionally professional and experienced. Drainage and pipes damage could be triggered by nails, screws, and other fasteners. A Baffle - A sink baffle beings in the sink flange and helps smother the sound of the disposal system. It also stops big objects from entering the disposal unit and prevents up splashing when the system is on.</p>
