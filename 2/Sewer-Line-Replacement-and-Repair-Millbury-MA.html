This is especially real if you have neglected difficult water, which consists of harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material in time.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing task.

This is naturally still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
