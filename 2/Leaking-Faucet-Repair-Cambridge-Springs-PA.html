<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
