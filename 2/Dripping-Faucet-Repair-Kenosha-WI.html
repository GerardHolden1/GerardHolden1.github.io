Over time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining a gallon or two helps get rid of the sediment. If you identify a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping task, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same material and they might be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
