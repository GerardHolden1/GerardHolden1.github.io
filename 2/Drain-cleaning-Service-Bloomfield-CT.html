An apprentice plumbing license symbolizes a plumber who has actually just begun training. If you currently have an old one set up, you'll have to eliminate your garbage disposal initially.</p>

The typical cost of an aluminum garbage disposal varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has an average cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously hard to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll wish to work with someone who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>

How the disposal is connected to the sink differs based on brand name and type. If you need guidance, refer to your item directions or call the manufacturer. The disposal will generally be linked to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
