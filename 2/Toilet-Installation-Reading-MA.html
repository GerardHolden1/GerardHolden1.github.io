<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
