<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.
