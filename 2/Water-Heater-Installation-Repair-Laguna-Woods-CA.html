<p>In basic, toilets are pretty easy to repair and operate. Almost any part can be eliminated and replaced reasonably easily and quickly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Damaged toilets can do some truly extensive, costly, and ... stinky damage to a house. When something fails, and your kitchen sink draws back up, your toilet won't flush, or you can't shower, you need for professional assistance immediately. That's where High 5 Plumbing can be found in. With years of industry experience, we know how to deal with a variety of drain problems.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
