You can buy, with free shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then assist with installation, or you can merely install the system yourself.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it changed. A great guideline for hot water heater is this: since the life expectancy of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle.
