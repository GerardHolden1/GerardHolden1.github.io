<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for specific applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and ecological policies. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to avoid backflow variety from the reasonably basic to the really sophisticated and complex.</p>
